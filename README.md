    - Soul-searching exercise 

### **TO DO (5/28/2025)**
    - Create repository for python text generator
    - Have python generate a JSON file that contains variations of the phrase, "The paint is drying"
    - Have a start game feature (might be hard due to the website being statically hosted)
    - Resest feature
    - Allow for stimulating themes/colors
        - dark/light mode first, of course
